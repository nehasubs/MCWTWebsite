      <h1> The Struggles of the Week</h1><hr><br>



 
      <h2> While the week without technology will be an eye-opening experience, it will also come with a lot of hardships. Here are some of the main ones below...




</h2>
    <br>

        <h3>School Struggles</h3>
          
    <p><b> Q: How will I do schoolwork? </b></p>
    <p >  A: Nowadays most, if not all, of our course load is online. However, in these 7 days we would have to do all of our work on pen and paper. This will almost make us nostalgic for the time we were in elementary school. This will actually benefit us. For example, our writing skills will improve without the use of online text editor constantly checking our work.

</p>
    <br>
    <p ><b> Q: What if I have to ask my teacher a question? </b></p>
    <p >  A: Sending a text or email is no longer an option. Students will have to call their teacher using a landline. This is very inconvenient, however, by actually talking with our teachers we will be able to get a deeper level of understanding of the content.
</p><br>

<br>
 <h3>Work Struggles</h3>
          
    <p><b> Q: How will people communicate with colleagues? ?” </b></p>
    <p >  A: Because people only have access to a landline phone, they can't see any visual material. Tools we use in our work, such as Google Docs and other software that makes collaborating easier, will not be available. In order to do group work people would have to physically meet.
</p>
    <br>
    <p ><b> Q: What will no technology lead to less work efficiency? </b></p>
    <p >  A: Not necessarily. While working together in real life is less convenient, it also forces better communication and collaboration. While project management tools do keep us on track, they can be made with pen and paper during this 7 days.</p><br>

<br>
 <h3>Communication Struggles</h3>
          
    <p><b> Q: How will people communicate with loved ones?</b></p>
    <p >  A: There will be no “Facetime” or “Skype” options during this time. Because of this maybe people will actually see their loved ones. The best way to show people you care is to meet them face to face rather than through a phone.

</p>
    <br>
    <p ><b> Q: How will people tell their friends about my life without social media? </b></p>
    <p >  A: People will have to communicate with their words. Whenever my friends and I are at our lunch table all of us just end up on our phones and don’t even talk to one another. By getting rid of our distractions, we can actually have genuine conversations with each other.
